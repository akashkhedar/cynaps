# Cynaps

Cynaps is a complex, NX-managed project divided into three main components:

## [Main App (`apps/Cynaps`)][lso]

This is the primary application that consolidates all frontend framework elements. It's the hub for integrating and managing the different libraries and functionalities of Cynaps.

## [Library - Cynaps Frontend (`libs/editor`)][CF]

Cynaps Frontend, developed with React and mobx-state-tree, is a robust frontend library tailored for data annotation. It's designed for seamless integration into your applications, providing a rich set of features for data handling and visualization. Customization and extensibility are core aspects, allowing for tailored annotation experiences.

## [Library - Datamanager (`libs/datamanager`)][dm]

Datamanager is an advanced tool specifically for data exploration within Cynaps. Key features include:

## Installation Instructions

1 - **Dependencies Installation:**

- Execute `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install all necessary dependencies.

2 - **Environment Configuration (Optional for HMR):**

- If you want to enable Hot Module Replacement (HMR), create an `.env` file in the root Cynaps directory.
- Add the following configuration:
  - `FRONTEND_HMR=true`: Enables Hot Module Replacement in Django.

Optional configurations (defaults should work for most setups):

- `FRONTEND_HOSTNAME`: HMR server address (default: http://localhost:8010).
- `DJANGO_HOSTNAME`: Django server address (default: http://localhost:8080).

If using Docker Compose with HMR:

- Update the `env_file: .env` directive in `docker-compose.override.yml` under the app service.
- Rerun the app or docker compose service from the project root for changes to take effect.

To start the development server with HMR:

- From the `web` directory: Run `yarn dev`
- Or from the project root: Run `make frontend-dev`

#### Custom Configuration for DataManager:

- If you need to customize the configuration specifically for DataManager, follow these steps:
  - Duplicate the `.env.example` file located in the DataManager directory and rename the copy to `.env`.
  - Make your desired changes in this new `.env` file. The key configurations to consider are:
    - `NX_API_GATEWAY`: Set this to your API root. For example, `http://localhost:8080/api/dm`.
    - `LS_ACCESS_TOKEN`: This is the access token for Cynaps, which can be obtained from your Cynaps account page.
- This process allows you to have a customized configuration for DataManager, separate from the default settings in the .env.local files.

## Usage Instructions

### Key Development and Build Commands

- **Cynaps App:**
  - `yarn ls:dev`: Build the main Cynaps app with Hot Module Reload for development.
  - `yarn ls:watch`: Build the main Cynaps app continuously for development.
  - `yarn ls:e2e`: Run end-to-end tests for the Cynaps app.
  - `yarn ls:unit`: Run unit tests for the Cynaps app.
- **Cynaps Frontend (Editor):**
  - `yarn CF:watch`: Continuously build the frontend editor.
  - `yarn CF:serve`: Run the frontend editor standalone.
  - `yarn CF:e2e`: Run end-to-end tests for the frontend editor.
  - `yarn CF:integration`: Run integration tests for the frontend editor.
  - `yarn CF:unit`: Run unit tests for the frontend editor.
- **Datamanager**
  - `yarn dm:watch`: Continuously build Datamanager.
  - `yarn dm:unit`: Run unit tests for Datamanager.
- **General**
  - `yarn build`: Build all apps and libraries in the project.
  - `yarn ui:serve`: Serve the Storybook instance for the shared UI library.
  - `yarn test:e2e`: Run end-to-end tests for all apps and libraries.
  - `yarn test:integration`: Run integration tests for all apps and libraries.
  - `yarn test:unit`: Run unit tests for all apps and libraries.
  - `yarn lint`: Run biome linter across all files with autofix.
  - `yarn lint-scss`: Run stylelint linter across all scss files with autofix.

### Git Hooks

This project uses python `pre-commit` hooks to ensure code quality. To install the hooks, run `make configure-hooks` in the project root directory.
This will install the hooks and run them on every pre-push to ensure pull requests will be aligned with linting for both python and javascript/typescript code.

If for any reason you need to format or lint using the same `pre-commit` hooks directly, you can run `make fmt` or `make fmt-check` respectively from the project root directory.
